HMG: xBase Development System For Windows
-----------------------------------------

HMG is the union of these main components:

	- HMG Library and preprocessor directives
	- HMG IDE
	- MingW Compiler
	- Harbour Compiler

All together, these tools conform a completely free xBase Windows development
system, combining the traditional xBase, with an extremely easy to use GUI.
